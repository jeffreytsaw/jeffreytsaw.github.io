    <p>Hi! My name is Jeffrey and welcome to my blog and website!</p>

    <p>
      I'm a co-founder at
      <a href="https://www.creativemode.net/">CreativeMode</a>, where we're
      building an AI powered Minecraft mod creator. Before that, I was a
      software engineer at
      <a href="https://www.crusoeenergy.com/">Crusoe Energy</a> where I worked
      on Bitcoin miner firmware and orchestration for the distributed miner
      fleet.
    </p>

    <p>
      I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University,
      graduating with my M.S and B.S in 2022 and 2021. A while ago I wrote some
      reflections from CMU and my opinions on the courses I took. You can find
      that <a href="/college">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm interested in deep learning, especially RL and multimodal ML, and
      computer architecture and embedded systems. These days, I spend a lot of
      time exploring (i) multi-agent systems (ii) advances and optimizations in
      LLM architectures, and (iii) miscellaneous hardware and algorithm things
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy teaching, and playing sports (hockey, tennis,
      climbing, and golf). I'm also trying to write more but we'll see how that
      goes.
