I"æD<p>Inspired by <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=advice_column">Professor Hoe‚Äôs Advice</a>, I wanted to share and reflect on my journey through college at CMU so far.</p>

<p><strong>Before CMU:</strong> I finished high school with 2 years of IB math and physics. I also had a solid competition math background (nothing crazy, just regional competitions, and AMC 12, and AIME). My programming experience was limited to failed attempts to learn python on codeacademy, so no real coding experience.</p>

<p><strong>Major</strong>: I came in restricted undeclared engineering and had really no idea what I wanted to do. At first I wanted to do Materials Science and Engineering, but decided it wasn‚Äôt for me after the intro course. In the end, I thought the upper level ECE courses looked the most interesting, so I applied at the end of freshmen year, and luckily, they let everyone who apply transfer to ECE.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My goals changed a lot through my first 3 years at CMU. I‚Äôve gone from wanting to do MatSci research to working as a software engineer, to working as a hardware design engineer. Now, my interest has shifted to ML, especially deep reinforcement learning, and my plan is is to try and pursue a PhD in CS focusing on deep learning and robotics.</p>

<p><strong>‚òÜ</strong>: courses that really stood out to me and, in my opinion, are genuinely worth taking.</p>

<h2 id="general-advice">General Advice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Take courses you‚Äôre interested in, even if they‚Äôre notoriously difficult</em> - college is a unique opportunity to learn from renown experts in a structured environment. Take advantage of this by taking classes you‚Äôre genuinely interested in, and don‚Äôt be afraid if it lowers your GPA, in the long run it won‚Äôt matter that much. If you‚Äôre major recommends a calculation based course like 36-225, but you prefer proofs and pure math approach like 21-325, email your advisor to see if you can take the one you want! You‚Äôll enjoy your courses a lot more if you‚Äôre mostly taking courses thata interest you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help</em> - Knowing when to ask for help will save you a ton of time on assignments. I used to waste so much time staring at the same debug statements and rereading the handout. Don‚Äôt do this, bounce ideas off the TAs and friends, go to OH and ask them to explain things again. You‚Äôll find that you‚Äôll not only understand the material better, but also understand the mistake you made. I‚Äôm not saying be reliant on the TAs and others, definitely try and do things on your own, but if you get lost or helplessly stuck, don‚Äôt be afraid to get help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Others‚Äô successes are their own, don‚Äôt compare yourself to others</em> - There‚Äôs a ton of really smart people out there. Inevitably, it‚Äôs gonna feel like everyone around you is landing interviews or getting offers from crazy companies or research labs. If you‚Äôre not one of these people don‚Äôt get discouraged, and definitely don‚Äôt tie your self-worth to the kind of internships you land or the publications you have. It‚Äôs definitely something I still struggle with, but remember, what others achieve isn‚Äôt a reflection of you. Keep pursuing your passion, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you what to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Enjoy the little things</em> - CMU is tough. It‚Äôs going to seem like every class you‚Äôre taking is throwing assignments at you faster than you can keep up and you have no time between school, clubs, and friends. Just remember, no matter how important an exam may seem, one exam doesn‚Äôt make or break your grade, one class doesn‚Äôt make or break your GPA. Don‚Äôt miss out on making memories, in 10 years you probably won‚Äôt remember what was on your exams, but you will definitely remember the adventures you had.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Read <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things/">this</a></em> - Even though it‚Äôs almost 15 years old, it‚Äôs absolutely still relevant.</p>

<h2 id="fall-2017">Fall 2017</h2>
<ul>
  <li>21-122: Integration and Approximation
    <ul>
      <li>Standard Calc II material, I hadn‚Äôt seen taylor series and limit convergence before so that was cool.</li>
      <li>Pretty good if you‚Äôre not confident in integration skills, made me more confident when I took integration heavy courses like 21-259 and every signals course.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 33-141: Physics I for Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>Very good class, Anderson genuinely cares about his students, it‚Äôs a nice way to ease into college type classes.</li>
      <li>Covers kinematics, mechanics, energy and momentum, and thermo.</li>
      <li>I liked the way Newton‚Äôs laws are taught, Anderson is very thorough. The change of reference frame approach to collisions is also interesting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>27-100: Engineering Materials of the Future
    <ul>
      <li>The MatSci intro course, learned a lot of crystal structures, wasn‚Äôt really my thing.</li>
      <li>Virtually no work though, homework answers are given in recitation, and you do get to make a ring in the last lab.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 79-104: Global Histories -The Rise and Fall of the British Empire
    <ul>
      <li>Genuinely surprised by how interesting the material was, Roszman was a great lecturer</li>
      <li>Covered Britiish Imperialism from 17th century to 20th century. Probably the first time I enjoyed listening to someone talk about history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 43 units - light</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I had credit for both 21-122 and 33-141 but I wasn‚Äôt confident IB was sufficient preparation. In hindsight, I should‚Äôve skipped both of these classes, and tried for the honors freshman math track of 21-242 and 21-269 instead. Oh well, the free time was nice and I got to enjoy a nice gentle transition to CMU and college life. Also, take C@CM during the summer.</p>

<h2 id="spring-2018">Spring 2018</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚òÜ 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science
    <ul>
      <li>This course will make you a good programmer even if you had 0 experience like me.</li>
      <li>Assignments definitely took time to write and debug but if you put the time in you will come out a much better programmer.</li>
      <li>Final project is a great experience building something cool from scratch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18-100: Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering
    <ul>
      <li>Required for future ECE majors. Lectures were super confusing, a lot of material was thrown at us but none of it was explained very well.</li>
      <li>Go to SI and/or sign up for EXCEL. Seriously it will save your life. This and the 50% of marks lossed back for doing exam corrections.</li>
      <li>Labs were brutal. Go to lab early, so you can finish early. Nothing is worse than finishing at 11pm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-259: Calculus in 3 Dimensions
    <ul>
      <li>Computational approach to multivariable calculus</li>
      <li>Back half of the course felt pretty rushed like Stokes‚Äô and Divergence theorem</li>
      <li>Should have taken 21-268 or waited to take 21-269, I wanted more rigor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>76-101: Interpretation and Argument - Something to do with fake news
    <ul>
      <li>Wodzak was a good professor, not much reading and not much writing</li>
      <li>Fake news also seemed like one of the more interesting interp topics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-101: Freshman Math Seminar - Fractals and Chaos (mini)
    <ul>
      <li>I took this cause I missed rigorous proof-based math.</li>
      <li>Ended up being a bunch of analysis topics taught by Flaherty like open/closed sets, metric spaces, Hausdorff metric. Scary, but interesting</li>
      <li>Take home final was scary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-126: Intro to Mathematical Software
    <ul>
      <li>‚Äúlearned‚Äù a bunch of software like MATLAB, LaTex, Mathematica, Maple. I don‚Äôt remember much from this course if I‚Äôm honest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>99-251: Seminar in Supplemental Instruction
    <ul>
      <li>2 hour seminar to prepare you to teach for Academic Development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 52.5 units - moderate, majority of the work came from 112</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> 21-126 really wasn‚Äôt worth taking in my opinion. I should‚Äôve held off taking 21-259 and tried to take one of the more theory heavy versions, I think I would‚Äôve enjoyed that more. I originally was going to take 21-127 (concepts) instead of 21-259, but was talked out of it becasue 21-127 has a reputation for being difficult. In hindsight I should‚Äôve taken concepts. On the bright side, since the workload wasn‚Äôt that bad it meant my first carnival was a lot of fun!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relax and Recover
    <ul>
      <li>I recruited a bit at the TOC and on handshake, but didn‚Äôt land any internships. I stayed in Pittsburgh for a month after school ended in an attempt to do research, but didn‚Äôt really get anywhere.</li>
      <li>I went home sometime in July to catch up with friends and spend time with my family.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fall-2018">Fall 2018</h2>
<ul>
  <li>EXCEL: 21-259: Calculus in Three Dimensions
    <ul>
      <li>I had 3 separate sessions of 9 students, but I only had to prepare material once a week</li>
      <li>The 3 leaders held their own exam reviews, but we really should‚Äôve combined into 1 large one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation
    <ul>
      <li>Felt more like an intro to real CS, you learn search, sorts, and data structures</li>
      <li>Coding with contracts, invariants, will be a lifesaver in future systems courses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 18-240: Structure and Design of Digital Systems
    <ul>
      <li>Nace is a great lecturer and the material was interesting. I liked how the course builds in complexity, from combinational logic to sequential logic, and finally hardware threads.</li>
      <li>Labs were tedious and time consuming and homeworks were frustratingly vague and the time pressure in exams was brutal</li>
      <li>Finishing lab 5 was probably the happiest I‚Äôd been in a long time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>33-142: Physics II for Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>Lectures were pretty confusing, so reading the textbook was honestly a life saver</li>
      <li>Content moves pretty quick and the exams and final is pretty much your entire grade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-127: Concepts of Mathematics
    <ul>
      <li>A first class in proof based math, covers proof methods, sets, functions, relations, and basic number theory and combinatorics.</li>
      <li>Pretty much review for anyone that‚Äôs done competition math before, tough if you‚Äôve never written a proof.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>82-191: Elementary Russian I
    <ul>
      <li>Chill class, Russian is a super cool language to learn.</li>
      <li>When else are you going to get a chance to learn a new language in a structured manner</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18-200: ECE Sophomore Seminar
    <ul>
      <li>You just sit and listen to a random talk about ECE for an hour and write a reflection each week.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 57 units - heavy, pretty much seemed like an endless barrage of assignments the entire semester.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I do <strong>not</strong> recommend this course combination. The number of assignments was brutal. I think I had something due everyday of the week, so it really felt like I was constantly doing homework. By the time midterm season rolled around I was almost relieved because it meant less assignments. I think I ended up starting majority of my 33-142, and 21-127 homeworks the night before it was due. I only survived because my competition math background saved a TON of time for 21-127. EXCEL was a lot of fun, and I really fell in love with teaching, but it did mean I my Sundays and Monday nights were spent teaching so I had less time to finish my assignments.</p>
<h2 id="spring-2019">Spring 2019</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚òÜ TA: 15-462 - Computer Graphics
    <ul>
      <li>See General Advice regarding TAing (TLDR: you should try it).</li>
      <li>Working with students at OH can be fun, although it can be very hard to pinpoint issues in their code.</li>
      <li>Over winter break I started working on re-writing the course codebase to be much cleaner, faster, and less confusing. I hope to deploy it fall 2020. Support for this project has been very encouraging, and being able to have this much influence over the course is surprising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>‚òÜ 15-259: Probability and Computing
    <ul>
      <li>Very well run, in-depth, and fast-paced. Highly recommended over the other probability options unless you want pure math, in which case you should take 21-325 or a measure theory course.</li>
      <li>Includes CS applications of probability such as randomized algorithms, performance modeling, and Markov chains, which are all relevant to many areas of CS.</li>
      <li>Mor is great. She is experienced, enthusiastic, and cares about student success.</li>
      <li>Moderate workload: one problem set every week. Exams are pretty easy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>‚òÜ 15-458: Discrete Differential Geometry
    <ul>
      <li>More of a math class than a CS class, but the CS portion (implementing results &amp; algorithms on real meshes) makes results tangible and very rewarding.</li>
      <li>Probably my favorite math class ever, highly recommended if you are into geometry at all.</li>
      <li>Keenan is great (again), and in this class especially, his slides, diagrams, and animations are very elegant. They‚Äôre used to teach this content all over the world.</li>
      <li>Light workload: one moderate problem set + one short programming assignment every 2 weeks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>‚òÜ 15-410: Operating System Design and Implementation
    <ul>
      <li>Infamous for being the highest straight workload class in CS. It really is a ton of work, but maybe not quite as much as people say.</li>
      <li>The staff will not make design decisions for you or debug your code‚Äîyou must learn to design, test, evaluate, and debug a substantial project, from scratch, yourself.</li>
      <li>I found that most of the work is debugging‚Äîif you‚Äôre not an effective debugger, this course will make you become one.</li>
      <li>You need to be able to work well with your partner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> moderate, but heavy during OS project weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> as you can see, everything this semester has a star‚Äîall are highly recommended. Coronavirus made everything a bit crazy, but PnC &amp; DDG finished more or less normally, and, while I don‚Äôt think OS changes were handled/communicated well, the kernel got completed and end-of-semester work was reduced. Also note that OS is not recommended as a first systems elective (especially as a sophomore), and I‚Äôm going to agree with that unless you had enough systems experience that you found 15-213 easy.</p>
