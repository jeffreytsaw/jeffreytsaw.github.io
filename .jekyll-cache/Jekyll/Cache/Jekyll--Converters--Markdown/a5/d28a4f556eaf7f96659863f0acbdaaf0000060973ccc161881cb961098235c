I"œ\<p>Inspired by <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=advice_column">Professor Hoe‚Äôs Advice</a>, I wanted to share and reflect on my journey through college at CMU so far.</p>

<p><strong>Before CMU:</strong> I took IB math, physics, english chinese, econ and chem. I also had a solid competition math background (nothing crazy, just regional competitions, and AMC 12, and AIME). My programming experience was limited to failed attempts to learn python on codeacademy, so no real coding experience.</p>

<p><strong>Major</strong>: I came in restricted undeclared engineering and had really no idea what I wanted to do. At first I wanted to do Materials Science and Engineering, but decided it wasn‚Äôt for me after the intro course. In the end, I thought the upper level ECE courses looked the most interesting, so I applied at the end of freshmen year, and luckily, they let everyone who apply transfer to ECE that year.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My goals changed a lot through my first 3 years at CMU. I‚Äôve gone from wanting to do MatSci research to working as a software engineer, to working as a hardware design engineer. Now, my interest has shifted to ML, especially deep reinforcement learning, and my plan is is to try and pursue a PhD in CS focusing on deep learning and robotics.</p>

<p><strong>‚òÜ</strong>: courses that really stood out to me and, in my opinion, are genuinely worth taking.</p>

<h2 id="general-advice">General Advice</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Take courses you‚Äôre interested in, even if they‚Äôre notoriously difficult</em> - college is a unique opportunity to learn from renown experts in a structured environment. Take advantage of this by taking classes you‚Äôre genuinely interested in, and don‚Äôt be afraid if it lowers your GPA, in the long run it won‚Äôt matter that much. If you‚Äôre major recommends a calculation based course like 36-225, but you prefer proofs and pure math approach like 21-325, email your advisor to see if you can take the one you want! You‚Äôll enjoy your courses a lot more if you‚Äôre mostly taking courses thata interest you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help</em> - Knowing when to ask for help will save you a ton of time on assignments. I used to waste so much time staring at the same debug statements and rereading the handout. Don‚Äôt do this, bounce ideas off the TAs and friends, go to OH and ask them to explain things again. You‚Äôll find that you‚Äôll not only understand the material better, but also understand the mistake you made. I‚Äôm not saying be reliant on the TAs and others, definitely try and do things on your own, but if you get lost or helplessly stuck, don‚Äôt be afraid to get help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Take less classes</em> - There‚Äôs a lot of really interesting classes, and it‚Äôs going to be tempting to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Others‚Äô successes are their own, don‚Äôt compare yourself to others</em> - There‚Äôs a ton of really smart people out there. Inevitably, it‚Äôs gonna feel like everyone around you is landing interviews or getting offers from crazy companies or research labs. If you‚Äôre not one of these people don‚Äôt get discouraged, and definitely don‚Äôt tie your self-worth to the kind of internships you land or the publications you have. It‚Äôs definitely something I still struggle with, but remember, what others achieve isn‚Äôt a reflection of you. Keep pursuing your passion, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you what to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Read <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things/">this</a></em> - then read it again. It‚Äôs amazingly relevant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fall-2017">Fall 2017</h2>
<ul>
  <li>21-122: Integration and Approximation
    <ul>
      <li>Standard Calc II material, I hadn‚Äôt seen taylor series and limit convergence before so that was cool.</li>
      <li>Pretty good if you‚Äôre not confident in integration skills, made me more confident when I took integration heavy courses like 21-259 and every signals course.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 33-141: Physics I for Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>Very good class, Anderson genuinely cares about his students, it‚Äôs a nice way to ease into college type classes.</li>
      <li>I liked the way Newton‚Äôs laws are taught, Anderson is very thorough. The change of reference frame approach to collisions is also interesting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>27-100: Engineering Materials of the Future
    <ul>
      <li>The MatSci intro course, learned a lot of crystal structures, wasn‚Äôt really my thing.</li>
      <li>Virtually no work though, homework answers are given in recitation, and you do get to make a ring in the last lab.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 79-104: Global Histories -The Rise and Fall of the British Empire
    <ul>
      <li>Genuinely surprised by how interesting the material was, Roszman was a great lecturer</li>
      <li>Covered Britiish Imperialism from 17th century to 20th century. Probably the first time I enjoyed listening to someone talk about history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 43 units - light</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I had credit for both 21-122 and 33-141 but I wasn‚Äôt confident IB was sufficient preparation. In hindsight, I should‚Äôve skipped both of these classes, and tried for the honors freshman math track of 21-242 and 21-269 instead. Oh well, the free time was nice and I got to enjoy a nice gentle transition to CMU and college life. Also, take C@CM during the summer.</p>

<h2 id="spring-2018">Spring 2018</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚òÜ 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science
    <ul>
      <li>This course will make you a good programmer even if you had 0 experience like me.</li>
      <li>Assignments definitely took time to write and debug but if you put the time in you will come out a much better programmer.</li>
      <li>Final project is a great experience building something cool from scratch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18-100: Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering
    <ul>
      <li>Required for future ECE majors. Lectures were super confusing, a lot of material was thrown at us but none of it was explained very well.</li>
      <li>Go to SI and/or sign up for EXCEL. Seriously it will save your life. This and the 50% of marks lossed back for doing exam corrections.</li>
      <li>Labs were brutal. Go to lab early, so you can finish early. Nothing is worse than finishing at 11pm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-259: Calculus in 3 Dimensions
    <ul>
      <li>Computational approach to multivariable calculus</li>
      <li>Back half of the course felt pretty rushed like Stokes‚Äô and Divergence theorem</li>
      <li>Should have taken 21-268 or waited to take 21-269, I wanted more rigor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>76-101: Interpretation and Argument - Something to do with fake news
    <ul>
      <li>Wodzak was a good professor, not much reading and not much writing</li>
      <li>Fake news also seemed like one of the more interesting interp topics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-101: Freshman Math Seminar - Fractals and Chaos (mini)
    <ul>
      <li>I took this cause I missed rigorous proof-based math.</li>
      <li>Ended up being a bunch of analysis topics taught by Flaherty like open/closed sets, metric spaces, Hausdorff metric. Scary, but interesting</li>
      <li>Take home final was scary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-126: Intro to Mathematical Software
    <ul>
      <li>‚Äúlearned‚Äù a bunch of software like MATLAB, LaTex, Mathematica, Maple. I don‚Äôt remember much from this course if I‚Äôm honest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>99-251: Seminar in Supplemental Instruction
    <ul>
      <li>2 hour seminar to prepare you to teach for Academic Development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 52.5 units - moderate, majority of the work came from 112</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> 21-126 really wasn‚Äôt worth taking in my opinion. I should‚Äôve held off taking 21-259 and tried to take one of the more theory heavy versions, I think I would‚Äôve enjoyed that more. I originally was going to take 21-127 (concepts) instead of 21-259, but was talked out of it becasue 21-127 has a reputation for being difficult. In hindsight I should‚Äôve taken concepts. On the bright side, since the workload wasn‚Äôt that bad it meant my first carnival was a lot of fun!</p>

<h2 id="summer-2018">Summer 2018</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Relax and Recover
    <ul>
      <li>I recruited a bit at the TOC and on handshake, but didn‚Äôt land any internships. I stayed in Pittsburgh for a month after school ended in an attempt to do research, but didn‚Äôt really get anywhere.</li>
      <li>I went home sometime in July to catch up with friends and spend time with my family.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fall-2018">Fall 2018</h2>
<ul>
  <li>EXCEL: 21-259: Calculus in Three Dimensions
    <ul>
      <li>I had 3 separate sessions of 9 students, but I only had to prepare material once a week</li>
      <li>The 3 leaders held their own exam reviews, but we really should‚Äôve combined into 1 large one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TAA: 33-141 Physics I for Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>Basically show up to recitation twice a week and answer questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation
    <ul>
      <li>Felt more like an intro to real CS, you learn search, sorts, and data structures</li>
      <li>Coding with contracts, invariants, will be a lifesaver in future systems courses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 18-240: Structure and Design of Digital Systems
    <ul>
      <li>Nace is a great lecturer and the material was interesting. I liked how the course builds in complexity, from combinational logic to sequential logic, and finally hardware threads.</li>
      <li>Labs were tedious and time consuming and homeworks were frustratingly vague and the time pressure in exams was brutal</li>
      <li>Finishing lab 5 was probably the happiest I‚Äôd been in a long time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>33-142: Physics II for Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>Lectures were pretty confusing, so reading the textbook was honestly a life saver</li>
      <li>Content moves pretty quick and the exams and final is pretty much your entire grade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>21-127: Concepts of Mathematics
    <ul>
      <li>A first class in proof based math, covers proof methods, sets, functions, relations, and basic number theory and combinatorics.</li>
      <li>Pretty much review for anyone that‚Äôs done competition math before, tough if you‚Äôve never written a proof.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>82-191: Elementary Russian I
    <ul>
      <li>Chill class, Russian is a super cool language to learn.</li>
      <li>When else are you going to get a chance to learn a new language in a structured manner</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18-200: ECE Sophomore Seminar
    <ul>
      <li>You just sit and listen to a random talk about ECE for an hour and write a reflection each week.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 57 units - heavy, lots of assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The sheer number of assignments was pretty rough. I‚Äôve seen most of the 21-127 material before so that saved my life. 18-240 was definitely my favourite course, the labs were tough but super rewarding. It was also interesting to see the difference in writing software and hardware. The computer architecture part of this course was my favourite, it really demystified what aa CPU is.  EXCEL was a lot of fun, and I really fell in love with teaching, but it did mean I my Sundays and Monday nights were spent teaching so I had less time to finish my assignments.</p>

<h2 id="spring-2019">Spring 2019</h2>
<ul>
  <li>EXCEL: 33-142 Physics II for Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>I had 3 sessions again, but it was definitely easier preparing this time round</li>
      <li>All the leaders held 1 exam review for each exam so I didn‚Äôt need to prep as hard we just reused old handouts. There were 5 exam reviews in total, felt like one every 3 weeks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 15-213 - Introduction to Computer Systems
    <ul>
      <li>Great course that really goes in depth into the memory stack and other elements to computer systems.</li>
      <li>Lectures are recorded and pretty good (maybe correlated)</li>
      <li>Labs are pretty time consuming if it‚Äôs all new to you but you‚Äôll learn to write and debug code much better than you had to in 122/112.</li>
      <li>Exams are terrifying, you get your grade as soon as you press submit. Double and triple check your answers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 18-290 - Signals and Systems
    <ul>
      <li>Sankaranarayanan is a great lecturer and made a lot of the scary ideas in signals pretty intuitive. He made me want to take a deeper signals course.</li>
      <li>Fourier and Laplace transforms look scary but it‚Äôs just math, don‚Äôt worry 21-122 prepared you well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18-202: Mathematical Foundations of ECE
    <ul>
      <li>This course really needs to be reworked. The first quarter is review from 21-127, and the next 3/4s are complex numbers, differential equations and linear algebra.</li>
      <li>Way too many disjoint topics are crammed into this course so nothing is taught well. If you want to learn diffeq, take 21-260, if you want to learn linear algebra, take 21-241, this course will not teach it well.</li>
      <li>The only saving grace is that this course can be used as a prereq for any course that requires 21-241, so ECE kids can take 10-301 (intro to ML)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>33-211: Physics III: Modern Essentials
    <ul>
      <li>I took this because it was a prereq for 33-234 (Quantum Physics), but it turned out to be ok.</li>
      <li>I did a bit of special relativity in IB Physics so I thought it‚Äôd be review, but this really goes in depth into the transformations and using the invariants. The stuff about general relativity, time dilation, and the skim of QM was also interesting</li>
      <li>The 8:30 recitation was a little too early and I‚Äôm really glad those quizzes didn‚Äôt destroy my grade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 46 units - moderate, but heavier during the back half of 213 assignments</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I wanted to take it a little easier after the fall semester, so I decided not to overload. I also wanted to bang a bunch of my ECE requirements out early so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry as I prepared to study abroad next spring. I cannot stress enough how great 15-213 is as a class, you really learn how to design code and methodically debug. It‚Äôs also a class you should try and work alone as much as possible, there‚Äôs tons of students who get caught cheating every semester.</p>

<h2 id="summer-2019">Summer 2019</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TA: 15-213/15-513/18-613 Introduction to Computer Systems
    <ul>
      <li>I recruited a bit but didn‚Äôt get any offers, so I decided to be a TA for the summer session.</li>
      <li>Teaching and answering questions really helps reinforce the material, and I definitely felt I had a better grasp of some of the concepts after the summer</li>
      <li>Trying to read, understand, and help debug other people‚Äôs code is horrible. Following a line of logic that isn‚Äôt yours is extremely difficult. Please understand the more code you write the harder it will be for a TA to pinpoint the mistake.</li>
      <li>Style grading was tedious, especially when there were 40 of them to do. You see some ridiculous code (I‚Äôm looking at you, Master‚Äôs students.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fall-2019">Fall 2019</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SI: 33-141: Physics I For Engineering Students
    <ul>
      <li>Biweekly sessions meant I had to prepare material twice a week, which got tough as my assignments piled up.</li>
      <li>Solo hosting exam reviews for 100+ students is super scary. The room is hard to control and you kind of just have to let them do whatever.</li>
      <li>Seeing the same students at every session is my favourite part of this job.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 18-341: Logic Design and Verification
    <ul>
      <li>Lectures were interesting, but the real meat of the class were the projects</li>
      <li>Projects were essentially designing and debugging large hardware threads</li>
      <li>Staff will not debug anything for you. Hardware isn‚Äôt like software. It either works or doesn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs no in between. You will become very good at thinking in hardware</li>
      <li>Debugging EDGE for USB was a nightmare. Finishing USB was better than finishing lab 5 for 18-240</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 18-349: Introduction to Embedded Systems
    <ul>
      <li>Rowe is not a great lecturer, lectures only matter for exams really.</li>
      <li>The code you write interfaces almost directly with hardware and MMIO devices so writing the drivers for those was pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Reading pages and pages of information sheets about the hardware was most definitely not cool.</li>
      <li>Lab 4 was exciting, easily the most complex and well thought out piece of code I‚Äôve written.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>‚òÜ</strong> 21-325: Probability Theory
    <ul>
      <li>A proof-based treatment of probability and statistics. A more rigorous treatment than the traditional 36-225 route for engineers</li>
      <li>If you like proofs you‚Äôll enjoy this course, there were little computation problems and there are several proofs of results presented in class.</li>
      <li>Poisson processes and Queuing theory is difficult. If you get it, please explain it to me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>18-220: Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits
    <ul>
      <li>This class does not live up to its reputation as the easiest ECE core, it was deceptively hard.</li>
      <li>Content moved super fast and the homeworks were not trivial. You had to have known what you‚Äôre doing.</li>
      <li>Labs were brutal again, I‚Äôm glad they told us what circuits to build. My labmates that helped with the oscilloscope and the TAs were life savers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>76-245: Shakespeare Tragedies &amp; Histories
    <ul>
      <li>Minimal work, lectures were pretty much listening to context about the plays as well as breakdowns of important scenes and symbols.</li>
      <li>It was definitely nice to practice analytical writing again. I had started to miss writing essays and analyses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> 54 units - death.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> 18-341 and 18-349 is a pretty tough combination. Make sure you have a good partner for 18-349. Material in both these classes was great if you like hardware/systems. I really enjoyed 21-325, I really like the abstract math part, and it was definitely fun to think in a write-proof kind of way, which is surprisingly different from writing code. I had to petition the department so I could count it for my probability/stat requirement, but it was definitely worth it, and I suggest others do it too if you liked 21-127. Being an SI leader was a lot more work than being an EXCEL leader, but I definitely started looking forward to the sessions.</p>

<h2 id="spring-2020">Spring 2020</h2>
<p>I studied abroad this semester at UCL. I applied early in the fall, and they notify you around November - December. I applied for Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELEC0024: Digital Signal Processing and Systems
    <ul>
      <li>The second half of the course on digital filter design was interesting, I wish they went more in depth into adative filtering, though.</li>
      <li>I also wish they broadened the scope a bit instead of focusing on determining which digital components make up this bode plot.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ELEC0029: Electronic Devices and Nanotechnology
    <ul>
      <li>First half focused on MOSFET fabrication processes. Found out that wasn‚Äôt my thing.</li>
      <li>The quantum physics half of the course was weird. They didn‚Äôt go in depth enough into the math of inherently mathy concepts like tunneling.</li>
      <li>To be honest I still don‚Äôt really know how a MOSFET works but I can tell you how they‚Äôre made!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>PSYC0016: Developmental Psychology
    <ul>
      <li>Lectures were super fast paced and there was a ton of material. Was hard to keep up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MSIN0059: Managerial Accounting for Decision Making
    <ul>
      <li>Surprisingly interesting, even if it didn‚Äôt go into details about bookkeeping.</li>
      <li>I didn‚Äôt like how seemingly open ended questions required you to touch upon specific points in order to get any points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload:</strong> Virtually None. UK universities have finals worth 70-100% of the final grade and with COVID a lot of assignments were cancelled.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Studying abroad was a lot of fun, before coronavirus of course. It was nice to take a break from CMU and the environment, and have an opportunity to explore a new city. I had a lot of fun playing competitive hockey again, until, unfortunately, our season was cut short. Coronavirus pushed a lot of my exams back and Developmental Psych cut their final, Accounting changed their exam to a written assignment, and the 2 ELEC classes had online exams. No homework throughout the semester was a plus at the time, but cramming meant I probably retained less. I did have time before exams to informally take <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/10701_S20/">10-701</a>, so that was a huge plus for me as I‚Äôve been wanting to learn ML for a while.</p>

<h2 id="summer-2020">Summer 2020</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credit Suisse: Technology Analyst Intern
    <ul>
      <li>I was super bummed when it got moved online, I knew a good number of people who were supposed to intern in NY with me.</li>
      <li>The 12 hour time difference meant I had to work 9pm - 5am.  Was rough.</li>
      <li>Work was generally interesting, it ended up being a lot of data cleaning and prep which felt super tedious, and I wanted more time to develop a better NLP model.</li>
      <li>I did meet a ton of cool people and learned a lot about capital markets and what banks actually do.</li>
      <li>Fintech has an interesting appeal over traditional software jobs, the focus in fintech is on how it impacts the business, which is interesting to see how scope affects the software you build.</li>
