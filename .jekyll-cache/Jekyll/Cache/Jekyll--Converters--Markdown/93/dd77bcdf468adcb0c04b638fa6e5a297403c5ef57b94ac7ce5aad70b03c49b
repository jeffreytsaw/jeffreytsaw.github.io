I"<p>Hi, and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to start one for a while now, ever since we had to keep one in 6th grade and I got excited to see people from different countries reading my random thoughts.</p>

<p>Anyways, as a quick introduction, my name is Jeffrey and I am an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before university, I grew up in Hong Kong and attended an international school there. I love teaching, music, and watching and playing sports. I grew up playing hockey (if you’re curious check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=193764335373126">This game from College</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCwjUzUuDO0&amp;t=275s">This game from High School</a>, and a <a href="https://www.hk01.com/即時體育/9540/周末運動-冰球-平昌冬奧熱血團體項目-盡情享受冰上極速快感?fbclid=IwAR0xWT7O1xhu0lRjyqvklX5sD9HahP90sBAvxOkUc9eAlEVoHjQP6UIWWWQ">Random Article</a>), tennis, and, more recently, golf.</p>

<p>My main objective with this blog is to write about interesting ideas that I have learned in school or through projects, and also share stories, experiences, and milestones that I’ve had as an undergraduate international student and beyond.</p>
