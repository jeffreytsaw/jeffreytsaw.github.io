I"Þ<p>Hi, and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been wanting to start one for a while now, ever since we had to keep one in 6th grade and I got excited to see people from all over reading my random thoughts. Anyways, as a quick introduction, my name is Jeffrey and I am an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before university, I grew up in Hong Kong and attended an international school there.</p>
