I"<p>Hi, and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to start one for a while now, ever since we had to keep one in 6th grade and I got excited to see people from all over reading my random thoughts.</p>

<p>Anyways, as a quick introduction, my name is Jeffrey and I am an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before university, I grew up in Hong Kong and attended an international school there. I love watching and playing sports, and grew up playing hockey (if you’re curious check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=193764335373126">My Most Recent game</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCwjUzUuDO0&amp;t=275s">Favrouite Moment (about 4:17) :)</a>, and a <a href="https://www.hk01.com/即時體育/9540/周末運動-冰球-平昌冬奧熱血團體項目-盡情享受冰上極速快感?fbclid=IwAR0xWT7O1xhu0lRjyqvklX5sD9HahP90sBAvxOkUc9eAlEVoHjQP6UIWWWQ">Random Article</a> ), tennis, and recently got into golf.</p>
