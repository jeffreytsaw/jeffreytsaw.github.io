I"B<p>No, <a href="https://github.com/TheNumbat/exile">Exile</a> is not technically a “voxel” engine. A real voxel engine unifies objects, textures, and more into colored voxel data, rendering them via raymarching/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">marching cubes</a>/<a href="https://upvoid.com/devblog/2013/05/terrain-engine-part-1-dual-contouring/">dual contouring</a>/etc., and can target realism. Instead, Exile is a “voxel” engine in that it’s a traditional 3D engine that happens to focus on representing and drawing textured cubes (like Minecraft and related games). Some have worked around this linguistic confusion by christening the technique <a href="https://yave.handmade.network/">“Swedish cubes”</a>, but for the purposes of this post, please assume that voxels imply textured cubes.</p>
