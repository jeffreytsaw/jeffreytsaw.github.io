# jeffreytsaw.github.io

Personal website for Jeffrey Tsaw, built using Jekyll and hosted by GitHub Pages. I took inspiration from a bunch of different websites and blogs: [Jason Peng](xbpeng.github.io), [Max Slater](thenumbat.github.io), and a bunch of other online tutorials.

To build locally:

```
jekyll build
jekyll serve --watch
```

## To update the home page:
1.  Update index.html
2.  Update style.css

## To post to the blog:
1. Add new post in /blog/_posts/
2. Update css/main.css
