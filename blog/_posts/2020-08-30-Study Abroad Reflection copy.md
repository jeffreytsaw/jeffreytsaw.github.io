Before COVID-19 and the craziness that followed, I spent the first half of my junior spring semester abroad in London, studying at UCL. I would say at CMU this isn't a popular choice, especially among ECE/CS students, so I thought I'd share a bit of why I decided to spend a semester abroad and my experience there (albeit a short one).

### **Background**
I came into CMU with the intention of studying abroad. I had friends that went to university in the UK, and I was always curious how different it was studying there versus the US. I had originally picked junior fall for my semester abroad, but one of the courses I really wanted to take (18-341 Logic Design and Verification) was fall only, so I decided to push it to the spring. I applied around September, and was accepted some time in November. 

### **Why I decided to study abroad**
There were three main reasons I chose to stud

 
 
 
 
 
 

```python3
    while (1):
        print(hello)
```
